                        There are so many interesting, new, unique ways that tech is interacting with the 
                        world. I am so excited to be a part of it.

        <h1>My name is Roxanne Robinson<br>
         I have two sons Walker is 5 and Weston is 11. 
         We live in Payson, Utah
        </h1>
        </div>
        <p> 
             Do I start at the beggining? In the 1900's as my son Weston says; or do I start now
            and go back? Probably better to start at the beggining.
            I grew up in Spanish Fork Utah. I Have 4 siblings and 4 neices and 5 nephews. I am blessed to 
            have an amazing family. My Grandpa &amp; Grandma Lived in Lake Shore, Utah in my youth. We spent a lot of time, sweat, and fun at 
            the farm. All of us that remember it have warm memories of those times. My Grandma and I would write letters through the post office then back and forth.
            My Grandpa &amp; Granadma Wood lived in brookside in Springville, Utah. We spent hours playing in the 
            flower and veggie gardens as children. As an adult My Grandma Wood and I would call every sunday and catch up on life. 
            My Grandma Peay and I sent letters by post back and forth for years. </p>
        
            <p> My first love was medicine. I had my CNA at the age of 17, and worked on an
        Diabetes type 3 (Alzheimers) unit. I quickly fell in love with my patients and their families.</p>                        

    <p> I then went on to study cosmetology at Paul Mitchell school of cosmetology, after 9 months I felt like I wasn't
    getting the education I desired and paid for. This is one of many examples of "fate" guiding me to where i need to go.
    I ended up meeting the amasing Mindi Martin at her hair salon on center street in Provo, Utah.
</p>
       
<p> My second love is animal medicine. 
    I worked as a Veterinary Technitian for almost 2 years.
    I learned so much more working hands on at CopperView Animal Hospital than I did in school.
    Dr. Nathan Stephenoff taught me more than my schooling. He was so patient and helped guide me through all 
    of the ways of animal medicine.</p>
<p>
     My new love is Tech-moms, and coding! Ive always been a hands on type worker and 
    was worried I wouldnt like or understand coding. Luckily to my delight I loved it! Working on a project and seeing 
    it come to life is just so much more than I was expecting. The diversity in tech is something I learned and was suprised
    to learn. It was exciting to learn theres a lot more to tech than just design.
