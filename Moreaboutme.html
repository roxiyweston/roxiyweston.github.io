                        There are so many interesting, new, unique ways that tech is interacting with the 
                        world. I am so excited to be a part of it.

    <p> My first love was medicine. I had my CNA at the age of 17, and worked on an
        Diabetes type 3 (Alzheimers) unit. I quickly fell in love with my patients and their families.</p>                        

    <p> I then went on to study cosmetology at Paul Mitchell school of cosmetology, after 9 months I felt like I wasn't
    getting the education I desired and paid for. This is one of many examples of "fate" guiding me to where i need to go.
    I ended up meeting the amasing Mindi Martin at her hair salon on center street in Provo, Utah.
</p>
       
<p> My second love is animal medicine. 
    I worked as a Veterinary Technitian for almost 2 years.
    I learned so much more working hands on at CopperView Animal Hospital than I did in school.
    Dr. Nathan Stephenoff taught me more than my schooling. He was so patient and helped guide me through all 
    of the ways of animal medicine.</p>
<p>
     My new love is Tech-moms, and coding! Ive always been a hands on type worker and 
    was worried I wouldnt like or understand coding. Luckily to my delight I loved it! Working on a project and seeing 
    it come to life is just so much more than I was expecting. The diversity in tech is something I learned and was suprised
    to learn. It was exciting to learn theres a lot more to tech than just design.
