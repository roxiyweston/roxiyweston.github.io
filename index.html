          <p><em>My name is Roxanne Robinson</em>
            <br>I have two sons Walker is 5 and Weston is 11. 
            </p>
             
            <p> 
             Do I start at the beggining? In the 1900's as my son Weston says; or do I start now
            and go back? Probably better to start at the beggining.</dl>
            I grew up in Spanish Fork Utah. I Have 4 siblings and 4 neices and 5 nephews. I am blessed to 
            have an amazing family.</p> 
            <br>
            <p></p>My Grandpa & Grandma Lived in Lake Shore, Utah in my youth. We spent a lot of time, sweat, and fun at 
            the farm. All of us that remember it have warm memories of those times. My Grandma and I would write letters through the post office then back and forth.
            My Grandpa & Granadma Wood lived in brookside in Springville, Utah. We spent hours playing in the 
            flower and veggie gardens as children. As an adult My Grandma Wood and I would call every sunday and catch up on life. 
            My Grandma Peay and i sent letters by post back and forth for years. 
                
            I grew up in Spanish Fork, Utah. I have worked all over Utah and adore the outdoors of our beautiful state.
            I worked and lived mainly in Utah County until I got married in 2011 and lived in Riverton, Utah, where I had my first child. We moved to Clinton, Utah
            I had my second son in 2019. I got divorced in 2021 and moved back to Payson in Utah county. I had missed the moutains, fields, and home town feel that I grew up in,
            and am so happy my kids get to grow up in the Country.</p>
            </p>
        <p>I have been working in customer service for over 25 years. And now I am learning how to apply those skills in a new field, and in new ways.</p>
